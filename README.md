💖 C# Devotee 💖

C# courses through my veins—fueling every wild project I conjure. Then there’s Rust: a steamy affair turned full-on obsession with its ruthless power and finesse.  
Day Gig: Crushing it with VB.NET and TypeScript, wielding Angular like a front-end warlord. Still rocking .NET—and loving every damn minute.
Real Life: Swapping keys for chisels with woodworking (I’m hooked), and carving digital masterpieces in Blender. I’m a one-man creation cyclone.  
The Grand Scheme? Fusing code, craft, and 3D sorcery into a mind-blowing mega-project. It’s simmering—brace yourself!

🔥 AI Zealot 🔥

I’ve been an AI junkie since OpenAI flung open its API doors. **Plot twist: I loathe OpenAI**. Give me the open-source titans—LLaMA, DeepSeek—every time. I’m that guy running these monsters on a scrappy home rig: 32GB NVIDIA beast-mode, 64GB RAM, and a multicore juggernaut. It devours DeepSeek’s 32B-parameter models (snagged from Hugging Face, juiced with open-source datasets) like it’s nothing.

- Elon Musk stan? Hell yes—I’m all in for his galaxy-brain moves. Shelling out $20 for X just to wield Grok 3 (unbelievably good) and proud to be an xAI API soldier.  
- Still, my homebrew models power my scrappy apps—I’m a DIY king.  
- Model crafting? Nah, I’m no lab-coat genius.  
- I’m the app-slinger, hacking away via API (and cringing at “OpenAI-compatible”).

Thanks if you read this far  🙏✨
